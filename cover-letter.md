Dear Goodfire Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Research Engineer position at Goodfire. Your mission to build safe and trustworthy AI systems deeply resonates with my passion and background. 

I believe I would be an excellent fit for this role based on the following:

## Mission alignment

My personal philosophy is to become a responsible person â€” for myself, my family, my community, and our society. As an ML professional, I want to take the responsibility in promoting safety and trustworthiness in the next generation of AI systems.

In the past few years, I've been dedicated to making AI systems more transparent and understandable. My efforts include but are not limited to:

- 2 peer-reviewed papers ([KDD 24'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03059), [ICDM 22'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01533)) on while-box ML models
- At Cambri, designing interpretable ML algorithms for concept validation that deliver transparent insights to clients
- At Upright, building interpretable Bayesian models for corporate environmental impact assessment
- At Unity, implementing SHAP-based explainability tools for production deep learning models
- Actively learning about interpretability and foundation models

## Technical fit

With 9+ years of professional experience, I bring the technical skills you seek:

**ML infra & research engineering**: I believe that excellent infrastructure *enables* excellent ML research, demonstrated by my contributions across different roles:

- Implemented data quality controls to minimize risks from the beginning
- Built data snapshoting components for reproducible research and hierarchical configuration system for efficient experimentation
- Reduced experimentation time through appropriate evaluation setups
- Led code refactoring initiatives to ensure inference-time code robustness
- Developed visualization tools to better understand model behavior

**Research-engineering bridge**: My background spans pure research (15+ papers in top venues like KDD, WebConf) and production engineering. I also build tools for researchers (me included) and am the creator of multiple open-source software ([stgym](https://github.com/xiaohan2012/stgym), [ers](https://github.com/xiaohan2012/efficient-rashomon-rule-set), [corset](https://github.com/DiverseMultiLabelClassificationRules/CORSET/blob/4858ccfb6a50a3a734511104e8b58dcf38e53eae/corset/samplers/dfs.pyx)).

**Distributed systems & scale**: I have extensive experience with PyTorch, Ray, and PySpark across research and production environments

- Built [distributed training pipelines](https://github.com/xiaohan2012/stgym) for large-scale experimentation using PyTorch, Torch Geometric, and Ray
- At Unity: multi-GPU model training, and terabyte-scale data pipelines re-design and optimization

**Systems programming & performance optimization**: I enjoy speeding up computer programs via hardware acceleration and algorithmic innovation:

- Accelerating [a model exploration tool](https://github.com/xiaohan2012/efficient-rashomon-rule-set) via search space pruning, multi-threading, and JIT, outperforming Google OR tools by 1000x.
- Scaling [a graph algorithm](https://github.com/xiaohan2012/signed-local-community) to networks with millions of nodes, via fast eigen decomposition and smart search.
- Speeding up [an efficient rule-set sampling algorithm](https://github.com/DiverseMultiLabelClassificationRules/CORSET/blob/4858ccfb6a50a3a734511104e8b58dcf38e53eae/corset/samplers/dfs.pyx) via Cython.
- Being immersed in [a system programming course](https://github.com/xiaohan2012/ppc2023) covering topics such as OpenMP, SIMD, and CUDA.

**Startup experience & velocity**: My recent roles at Cambri and The Upright Project have immersed me in fast-moving startup environments, where colleagues consistently recognize my efficient problem-solving skills and execution speed.

## Cultural fit

Your values align strongly with my work approach, as evidenced by my recent "Cambri Cultural Hero" award recognizing:

- **Put mission and team first**: I believe building responsible AI requires being a responsible team member first. My collaborative spirit has consistently energized teams toward shared goals.

- **Improve constantly**: In my current role, I am among the most active contributors in methodology improvements and technical enhancements, always striving for excellence. 

- **Take ownership and initiative**: One of my favorite mottos is "not do it, or do it well". Taking ownership brings me huge sense of accomplishment.

- **Action today**: Having worked in fast-moving startups, I thrive in high-pace environments where rapid iteration and immediate action are essential.

## Visa sponsorship

Please note that I would require visa sponsorship and may qualify for the O1 visa category given my research publications and technical expertise.
