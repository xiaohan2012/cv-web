Dear Anthropic Interpretability Team,

I am excited to apply for the Research Engineer, Interpretability role at Anthropic. 

Your team's focus on ML interpretability and building responsible AI resonates deeply with my career trajectory. Throughout my doctoral research on "Data Science for Social Good" and my recent industry roles, I have consistently prioritized building interpretable ML systems that users can trust. At Cambri, I'm currently designing interpretable algorithms that provide actionable insights for market research. At Upright, I developed Bayesian models with enhanced interpretability for environmental impact quantification. My postdoctoral work focused on creating interpretable rule-based learning algorithms with theoretical guarantees, resulting in publications at [KDD 24'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03059), [KAIS 23'](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-023-01930-6) and [ICDM 22'](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10027773). 

My experience directly translates to the requirements you've outlined:

**Software engineering excellence**: I have 15+ years of Python expertise and 10+ years building software systems. At Unity, I led a architecture overhaul that reduced code complexity by 50x. I've created multiple open-source ML research tools ([stgym](https://github.com/xiaohan2012/stgym), [ers](https://github.com/xiaohan2012/efficient-rashomon-rule-set), and [corset](https://github.com/DiverseMultiLabelClassificationRules/CORSET)) designed for agile experimentation, applying test-driven development and comprehensive QA practices.

**Research engineering experience**: I have 3+ years of empirical AI research in industry, developing privacy-constrained neural networks (using TensorFlow with multi-GPU training) and implementing SHAP-based explainability tools at Unity. My current research involves implementing distributed GNN training pipelines using PyTorch for spatial transcriptomics analysis, giving me hands-on experience with GPU optimization.

**Large-scale system optimization**: At Unity, I redesigned a terabyte-scale data pipeline achieving 25% performance improvement. I've implemented efficient model exploration algorithms that achieved 1000x speedup over Google OR-tools. My experience spans from SIMD and OpenMP to distributed computing with Ray and PySpark.

**Impact-driven prioritization**: At Cambri, I questioned existing model assumptions and improved accuracy from ~70% to 80+% across multiple model variants. I developed data snapshotting for reproducibility and implemented hierarchical configuration systems for faster experimentation.

**Collaborative attitude**: Having worked in both academia and fast-moving startups, I thrive in collaborative environments. Recently awarded "Cambri Cultural Hero" for energizing the team with collaborative spirit, I value the exchange of ideas and learning from others.

**Language modeling with transformers**: this is an area I'm actively developing.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to further discussion.

Sincerely,

Han Xiao
