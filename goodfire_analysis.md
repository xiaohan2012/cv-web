## Potential Gaps & Areas to Address ⚠️

### Technical Infrastructure
- **⚠️ Large foundation model experience**: Limited explicit experience with LLMs/transformer architectures
- **⚠️ Model internals/probing**: No direct mention of neural network internals analysis beyond SHAP
- **⚠️ Visualization tools**: Limited evidence of building analysis/visualization systems for model interpretation
- **⚠️ JAX experience**: Only PyTorch mentioned; Goodfire mentions PyTorch OR JAX
- **⚠️ Production ML deployment**: Strong research background, but less clear on production ML system maintenance

### Cultural Alignment
- **⚠️ Startup pace**: Academic timeline experience vs. "action today" startup mentality
- **⚠️ Fast iteration**: Research publication cycles vs. rapid prototyping expectations
- **⚠️ Infrastructure tooling**: Need to highlight experience building tools for other researchers/engineers
